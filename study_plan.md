## **Tutorial Plan**

### **Phase 1: Foundations of Statistics and Linear Algebra**  
Before diving into multivariate analysis, ensure mastery of key statistical and mathematical foundations.  

#### Topics:
1. **Probability & Statistics Refresher**  
   - Descriptive statistics: mean, variance, covariance, and correlation  
   - Probability basics: independence, conditional probability, Bayes’ theorem  
   - Random variables: discrete vs continuous, distributions (Normal, Multivariate Normal), expectations, variance, and covariance matrices  

2. **Matrix Algebra for Multivariate Analysis**  
   - Basics: vectors, matrices, matrix multiplication, determinants, inverse  
   - Eigenvalues and eigenvectors: their roles in dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA)  
   - Positive definite matrices (key in covariance matrices)  
   - Quadratic forms: \( x^T A x \), and their relationship with statistical measures  

3. **Hypothesis Testing Refresher**  
   - Basics of hypothesis testing (null and alternative hypotheses)  
   - Type I and II errors, p-values, confidence intervals  
   - ANOVA and its multivariate extension (MANOVA)  

#### Practical Work:
- Implement descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and basic matrix operations in Python using `NumPy`, `SciPy`, and `Pandas`.

   - Scree plots and explained variance  
   - PCA for preprocessing in machine learning  

3. **Factor Analysis (FA)**  
   - Differences between PCA and FA  
   - Latent variables and loadings

   - Relationship with PCA  

5. **Cluster Analysis**  
   - Hierarchical clustering: linkage methods and dendrograms  
   - K-means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)  
   - Cluster validity metrics: silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index  

6. **Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)**  
   - Intuition: finding linear combinations of variables that maximize correlation between two datasets  
   - Applications in machine learning and feature selection  

#### Practical Work:  
- Write Python implementations (or use libraries like `scikit-learn`) for PCA, LDA, and clustering.  
- Visualize clustering results and PCA projections.
